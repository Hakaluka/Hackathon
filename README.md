HOW TO USE :-  
1.Programms Required:-  
    python(such that we can use py command in the cmd) 
		
2.STEPs TO USE : -  
    DOWNLOAD gamecast.exe,video_converter.py and png.cpp, and store it in one folder  
    RUN gamecast.exe file and let it run in the back ground (make this step 2-3 minutes before starting your work or game)(NO GUI WILL BE DISPLAYED)  
    when ever u need instant replay of your recent activity just press and hold 'Alt'+'Q' keys untill cmd runs  
    wait till the video renders  
    after video is rendered it will be saved in your current directory(where you have stored gamecast.exe and video_converter.py)  
    this gives you replay of around 1 min of your recent activity in .avi format
